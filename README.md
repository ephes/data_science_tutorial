This tutorial covers topics that are relevant or interesting for me for
some kind of reason üòÑ. Have fun!

### Installation

You can run the chapter notebooks on your local machine or on [Google
Colab](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/).

On your local machine you need to clone the repo, create a virtualenv
and start your preferred notebook server.

``` sh
$ git clone git@github.com:ephes/data_science_tutorial.git
$ python -m venv venv
$ venv/bin/python -m pip install jupyterlab
$ venv/bin/jupyter lab
```

Usually, the dependencies needed for a notebook should be installed from
within the notebook itself using the `%pip` cell magic. Packages that
you install using `%pip` will be installed into the virtualenv that you
run the notebook server from. It should make no difference whether you
use classic or conda virtual environments.

# Foundations

üèó I added the notebooks below already because they should work, but they
are also still very much work in progress. üë∑

## Numpy

Numpy is the basis of a lot of stuff in related to data science in
Python.

**Chapter 08:** Numpy Overview Covering the Basic Features

- **Local:** [Notebook](08_numpy.ipynb)
- **Google Colab:** [Open in
  Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ephes/data_science_tutorial/blob/main/08_numpy.ipynb)

## Pandas

Pandas is very useful for all kinds of pre-processing and data cleaning.
