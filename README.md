This tutorial covers topics that are relevant or interesting for me for
some kind of reason üòÑ. Have fun!

# Text Classification

Maybe let‚Äôs start by doing some [text
classification](text_classification.ipynb) ([open in google
colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ephes/data_science_tutorial/blob/main/text_classification.ipynb)).

Is it possible to link directly to [word frequency
distribution](text_classification.ipynb#Word-frequency-distribution)?

# Foundations

üèó I added the notebooks below already because they should work, but they
are also still very much work in progress. üë∑

## Numpy

Numpy is the basis of a lot of stuff in related to data science in
Python. Here‚Äôs an [overview covering the base features](numpy.ipynb)
([open in google
colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ephes/data_science_tutorial/blob/main/numpy.ipynb)).

## Pandas

Pandas is very useful - [basic feature overview](pandas.ipynb) ([open in
google
colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ephes/data_science_tutorial/blob/main/pandas.ipynb)).
